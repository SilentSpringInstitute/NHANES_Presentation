# Introduction to analyzing NHANES data
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a nationally representative survey administered every two years by the Centers for Disease Control. 

NHANES includes demographic, dietary, examination, laboratory, and questionnaire data. The data is hosted on the NHANES project page at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/.

This presentation introduces what NHANES is, what data is available, and some analyses that are possible. Included is an R script that shows how to perform some of the analyses yourself.

The R script relies heavily on Silent Spring Institutes _RNHANES_ package, available on Github: https://github.com/SilentSpringInstitute/RNHANES
